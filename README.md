# divinity-companion-stats

This is a mod for the game Divinity: Original Sin that modifies companion stats to better effective, but balanced.
All companions start at Level 1, ready to be leveled up.

## Changes From Vanilla

Since the characters start at Level 1, I allocated 5 attribute points total for each companion.
